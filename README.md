Development process
Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the LEOcoin development team members simply pulls it.
If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the patch submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the appropriate channels.
The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions (see doc/coding.txt) or are controversial.
The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of LEOcoin.
Testing
Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.
Automated Testing
Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to submit new unit tests for old code.
Unit tests for the core code are in src/test/. To compile and run them:
cd src; make -f makefile.unix test
Unit tests for the GUI code are in src/qt/test/. To compile and run them:
qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
make -f Makefile.test
./LEOcoin-qt_test


qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
make -f Makefile.test
./LEOcoin-qt_test

To compile on ubuntu:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git build-essential libboost-all-dev libdb++-dev libminiupnpc-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/Leocoin-project/LEOcoin 
cd LEOcoin/src
make -f makefile.unix
